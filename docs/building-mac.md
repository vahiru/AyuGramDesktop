## Build instructions for macOS

### Note

The build has only been tested with Xcode 26.1. Although it may work on lower Xcode versions, this is not guaranteed.

Xcode 26 has deprecated AGL, so you need to remove "AGL" from CMake options [here](https://github.com/desktop-app/cmake_helpers/blob/c7e0493dea2b870fb1b8e26604201fdb9e8c1ee5/options_mac.cmake#L64).

### Prepare folder

Choose a folder for the future build, for example **/Users/user/TBuild**. It will be named ***BuildPath*** in the rest of this document. All commands will be launched from Terminal.

**Note about disk space:** The full build process will require approximately **55 GB** of free space. This includes:
- **~35 GB** for libraries (when building for both x64 and arm64 architectures)
- **~20 GB** for the compiled Telegram app (in the `out` folder)

### Clone source code and prepare libraries

Go to ***BuildPath*** and run

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    brew install git automake cmake wget pkg-config gnu-tar ninja nasm meson

    sudo xcode-select -s /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/AyuGram/AyuGramDesktop.git tdesktop
    ./tdesktop/Telegram/build/prepare/mac.sh

### Building the project

Go to ***BuildPath*/tdesktop/Telegram** and run

    ./configure.sh -D TDESKTOP_API_ID=2040 -D TDESKTOP_API_HASH=b18441a1ff607e10a989891a5462e627

Then launch Xcode, open ***BuildPath*/tdesktop/out/Telegram.xcodeproj** and build for Debug / Release.
